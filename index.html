        <h1>Intro questions: How to create a contact book using Java?</h1>
        <img src="img/contact.jpeg" height=30% width=30% alt="The photo of a contact book.">
        <p>You met a new friend on the freshman orientation day, and you ask for his/her contact information. You want to add
        him/her as a friend on your mobile contact. You type in the first name, last name, mobile phone number, and social
        media accounts.After editing the info, you open the contact app again, and see the new friend on the list.</p>
        <h4>Imagine you are a programmer who uses Java. How will you represent the contact book?</h4>
        <p>We know that the information are like elements. To add a certain element into your contact, you can create an
        array that stores the data, find the index of each element, and fill it. But we also know that one single array only supports one data type. Names are strings, phone numbers are integers,
            and social media accounts are strings.</p>
        <h4>So how do we add them on a single array?</h4>
        <p>One simple way is to convert the data type into one uniform data type. For example, convert the phone number integers
        into a number string. Problem Solved!</p>
        <h4>Really????</h4>
        <p>What if you mistype the contact information, and need to edit it later? What if you need to add more information like
        address? Can you simply just converting those arrays?</p>
        <p>There are many problems around this method. The separation between the data fields are messy, and we have to
            pass all the arrays related to one person, which is not practical. What can we do???</p>
