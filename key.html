        <h1>What is the central idea of OOP?</h1>
        <img src="img/key.jpeg" height=50% width=50% alt="The key items of the OOP.">
        <h3>Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism</h3>
        <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
        <p> By definition, Encapsulation means that all data fields of a class are declared private. Some
            methods may also be private. The class interacts with other classes only through the class’s
            constructors and public methods, which means that one class cannot see the other class's information.
            Encapsulation is often called "information hiding", which means to hide the detail of the inner workings
            of the class and other implementations. This is central because privacy is secured.
        </p>
        <p>Example: In the contact book, there are many functions like edit name and call this guy. When you edit the phone
        number of this guy, the function won't be able to call this guy.</p>
        <h1>Abstraction</h1>
        <p> By definition, an Abstraction is a process of exposing all the necessary details and hiding the rest.
            In Java, it is defined as the process of reducing the object to its essence so that only the
            necessary characteristics are exposed to the users.
        </p>
        <p> Example: If I am interested only in a guy's social media, the address information of this guy will be hidden.</p>
        <h1>Inheritance</h1>
        <p> By definition, Inheritance allows a developer to create a new class from an existing one.
            The existing class is called the superclass, and the derived class is called the subclass.
            The subclass inherits characteristics of the superclass, which means to inherit the methods and data
            defined by the super class. It's very useful because we can reuse the code we wrote for many times, and we don't
            need to write new one! It's also convenient for debug process.
        </p>
        <p>Example: In my contact book, there are many classifications like teachers, classmates, friends, etc. When I need to
        publish a secret post, I will give permission to the friends class only.</p>
        <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
        <p> By definition, Polymorphism means having many forms. It refers to the ability to process objects differently
            depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.
            A polymorphic reference is a variable that can refer to different types of
            objects at different points in time.Polymorphism ensures that the appropriate method is called for an object of a
            specific type when the object is disguised as a more general type.
