    <h1>What is OOP?</h1>
    <img src="img/oop.png" height=50% width=50% alt="The nice picture of OOP.">
    <p> By definition, OOP is a software design method that models the characteristics of real
        or abstract objects using software classes and objects. It helps design effective
        large scale software applications.</p>
    <h1>What is Class? What is Object?</h1>
    <p> By definition, a class is an object is a software bundle of related fields or variables and
        methods. An object is what the class is going to create. The characteristics of the object includes
        State (what the objects have), Behavior (what the objects do) , and Identity (what makes them unique).
        You can usually see many classes in one single program.
        In OOP, a program is a collection of objects that act on one another.
    </p>
    <h1>What is the different between OOP and other programming methods?</h1>
    <p> First we should understand software methodologies of design. In order to design a software, we must first think how
        to design it. The way of thinking is called paradigm, and a software paradigm is a way of thinking to design a software.
        In computer science, there are two main software paradigms: Structured Programming (Procedural Programming)
        and Object-Oriented Programming.
    </p>
    <p> You may be unfamiliar with these term, but you must know the most popular programming language in the current world.</p>
    <h3>Python!!!(Almost every subject uses it.)</h3>
    <p> Python is the example of Procedural Programming. The way of designing is to think in terms of steps and functions
        (methods and their composition). But Python is not great in many things. OOP is to think in terms of objects that do things.
    One simpler way to explain it is that OOP makes little legos and arrange them into a robot.
